## Overview

This project involved analyzing a bike sales dataset using Microsoft Excel. The objective was to uncover insights into customer behavior and purchasing patterns based on demographics and commute habits.

## Key Steps

### Data Cleaning
Removed duplicates, ensured consistency in data types, and formatted the dataset for analysis.

### Pivot Table Analysis

#### Income vs. Purchase Behavior:
Created a pivot table to compare the average income of males and females who purchased a bike versus those who did not. This helped identify income related trends in purchasing behavior across gender groups.

#### Commute Distance Analysis:
Grouped customers based on commute distance ranges (in miles) and analyzed how distance influenced the decision to purchase a bike. The pivot table highlighted key commute segments with higher or lower purchase rates.

#### Age Group Segmentation:
Categorized customers into age groups and compared bike purchase behavior across these segments. This analysis provided insights into which age demographics were more likely to buy bikes.

### Dashboard Creation:
Designed an interactive and visually intuitive dashboard using Excel tools like slicers, charts, and conditional formatting to display all major insights. The dashboard makes it easy for stakeholders to filter data and explore trends in real time.

## Insights & Outcomes:

  - Lower average income generally correlated with a greater likelihood of purchasing a bike, suggesting that affordability and cost-efficiency play a key role in their transportation choices.
  - Customers with shorter commute distances (especially those within 0-1 miles) were more inclined to buy bikes, suggesting they may be using them for short trips or daily commutes. This makes it essential to market bikes as convenient solutions for short distances, emphasizing portability and efficiency for quick travel.
  - Middle-aged adults (ages 30–54 years) showed higher purchase rates, posssibly due to greater family and work responsibilities that require reliable, flexible transportation options, alongside a growing awareness of health and environmental impact. Marketing campaigns should highlight the reliability, convenience, and versatility of bikes for everyday tasks such as commuting, school drop-offs, and errands. They should also emphasize how biking aligns with a busy lifestyle while promoting health, time efficiency, and environmental responsibility.
  - Bike purchase rates declined in older age groups (55+), possibly due to physical limitations or lack of interest in cycling. To better engage this demographic, businesses should explore alternative mobility products and promote electric bikes with comfort-focused features.
  - Customers aged 18–29 showed lower purchase behavior, indicating untapped market potential. Targeted strategies that emphasize affordability, trendy designs, and alignment with urban or student lifestyles could help increase engagement within this demographic.
